This icon theme was made by Bosky Cinek (visit http://boskastrona.ovh.org).
It's mostly a compilation of other icons:
	- Tango Desktop Project icons (http://tango.freedesktop.org/)
	- lots of icons I made, often using above icons
	- gnome-power-manager tango by dcubed20
	- tango-common icons from Ubuntu
